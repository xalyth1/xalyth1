### Welcome to my profile. Let's embark on this journey together. 😊💻
* I am currently working on developing an application <em>Words Vocabulary Learning Application</em> for learning foreign language vocabulary. My plan involves the following iterations in the near future:
   * Initially, I aim to create a desktop Java Swing GUI application with an embedded SQLite database. This version will serve as a fundamental step, focusing on database interaction, SQL queries, and utilization of the JDBC.
   * Following the completion of the first iteration, I intend to enhance the application by incorporating a REST API using SpringBoot, alongside the Java Swing GUI. Additionally, I plan to persist data in a server-side Postgres database.
   * As a final iteration, I envision transitioning the frontend of the application to React, while maintaining the SpringBoot backend with a REST API. This iteration will leverage a Postgres database for improved scalability and performance.
